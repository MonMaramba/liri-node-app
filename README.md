#*The Objectives*

1. This project is a part of my coursework requirements for the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp.
It aims to create a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface(*LIRI*).

1. This will be my first attempt at coding a back-end(or server-side) application.  

1. This will be the 2nd time that I'll be attempting the more challenging homework.

##User Notes

1. This will be deployed and hopefully, it will have some entertainment value. It will be more to highlight what I've learned so far.

1. You will need your own twitter and spotify keys to get this to run. Create a .env file with your Spotify id and secret plus your Twitter keys.

1. Please let me know if you have comments on how to make this app better or if you notice some bugs.

1. I would like to learn how to code better and if there's a better way of doing things, please don't hesitate to show me... and kindly explain to me as if I was a 12 year old :)

1. I am not expecting anybody needing help running this eventually but just in case, email monmaramba@yahoo.com.
